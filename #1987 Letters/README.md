## 문제
<p>A single-player game is played on a rectangular board divided in R rows and C columns. There is a single uppercase letter (A-Z) written in every position in the board. </p>

<p>Before the begging of the game there is a figure in the upper-left corner of the board (first row, first column). In every move, a player can move the figure to the one of the adjacent positions (up, down, left or right). Only constraint is that a figure cannot visit a position marked with the same letter twice. The goal of the game is to play as many moves as possible. </p>

<p>Write a program that will calculate the maximal number of positions in the board the figure can visit in a single game. </p>

## 입력
<p>The first line of the input file contains two integers R and C, separated by a single blank character, 1 ≤ R, S ≤ 20. </p>

<p>The following R lines contain S characters each. Each line represents one row in the board. </p>

## 출력
<p>The first and only line of the output file should contain the maximal number of position in the board the figure can visit. </p>
